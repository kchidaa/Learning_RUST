In line 8 and 9, both x and _y are pushed to stack as we know the size of both in compile time,
and it is obviously faster to access in stack. Hence once out of scope both will be deleted


Variable whose size is not known at compile time is allocated in heap and in rust, 
deep copy is not done automatically, instead shallow copy(move) is done for heap memory.

x = "hello" :- this is a string literal and is immutable and hence stored in stack and size is known as compile time
x = String::from("hello") :- this is special type called String. It is mutable and dynamic in size so size in not
                                known at compile time. and hence stored in heap.

As String (not string literals, line 20 and 21) are stored in heaps, the pointer to its location is passed
in to stack. when we copy it, we only copy its pointer to new variable to another variable in stack. hence when both variables
goes out of scope, it results in double free error (trying to release the same memory twice). which 
results in security vulnerabilities. This is a memory safety bug.

To solve this rust invalidates z once it is copied(moved) to another variable.

In line 20 and 23. once z is copied to _n. z is invalidated to avoid double free error.

hence, when _n goes out of scope it is then dropped(memory deallocated) and we don't need to worry about z.


It you want to deep copy data in heap, you need to clone it. which creates another copy in heap.
for example like in line 28 and 29. here s1 is not invalidated. using clone makes sense only when heap 
memory is involved as any copies on stack memory are deep copies(clones). 


The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: assigning a value to another variable moves it.
When a variable that includes data on the heap goes out of scope, 
the value will be cleaned up by drop unless ownership of the data has been moved to another variable.

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every function is a bit tedious. 
What if we want to let a function use a value but not take ownership? 
Itâ€™s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to be passed back if we want to use it again, 
in addition to any data resulting from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be common. 
Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without transferring ownership, called references.
